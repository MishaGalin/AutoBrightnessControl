          body: "The main change in version 1.3.x was adaptive brightness change depending on the content on the screen. I understand that not everyone needs such a feature, that's why there is an argument --adapt.\n\nAll brightness control functionality has been moved to the BrightnessController class, which has been moved to the bright_controller.py file.\n\nNow the application works correctly with both monitors that support brightness control and those that do not."
